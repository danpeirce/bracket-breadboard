# PICkit2, PICkit3 Programming Header to Breadboard Bracket (Master Branch - Arms removed)

This version of the README.md file will be updated with new photos as they becom available.

## Purpose of the bracket-breadboard SCAD Project
In APSC1299 and PHYS1600 a six pin programming header must be attached to a solderless breadboard. In the past this has been done with hot glue as a quick simple solution. A better long term solution is desirable. The last time I needed a bracket I turned to having it 3D printed and was happy with the result. This project lends itself nicely to 3D printing because the bracket will be small with fine features.

Final Version (to reduce cost attachment arms were left out)

## Creating a 3D Model using OpenSCAD

OpenSCAD is an free open source program that can be used for creating and viewing 3D models.

### The Model

This image is from the second version of the SCAD file

These images are from the [first version of the SCAD file](https://github.com/danpeirce/bracket-breadboard/blob/c5ccfa7ed66dbcf597f41a93814c27feb3500029/bracket_programming.scad).

## Prototype
 
These are the first images of the prototype that has been 3D printed in the KPU drafting department.

## Soldering Wire Onto the Programming Header

The end of the hookup wire was bent in a loop and crimped onto the pins below the bend of in each pin. Solder was applied.

Once the wire was cool the insulation was slipped down to insulate the wire up to the solder joint.

The header is inserted into the bracket from the back.

The end of the pins are snapped into place with a small flat screwdriver (they fit into a shallow narrow slot).

The bracket is twisted onto the board until it snaps in place.

The placement of the wire is adjusted.

The rest of the wires are placed into the grove, trimmed and stripped to complete connections.
