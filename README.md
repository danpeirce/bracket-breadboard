# PICkit2, PICkit3 Programming Header to Breadboard Bracket

## Purpose of the bracket-breadboard SCAD Project
In APSC1299 and PHYS1600 a six pin programming header must be attached to a solderless breadboard. In the past this has been done with hot glue as a quick simple solution. A better long term solution is desirable. The last time I needed a bracket I turned to having it 3D printed and was happy with the result. This project lends itself nicely to 3D printing because the bracket will be small with fine features.

## Creating a 3D Model using OpenSCAD

OpenSCAD is an free open source program that can be used for creating and viewing 3D models.
